# Curating Migrated Content

The process steps to curate migrated content in Architecture Center is described in the link that will be provided to you
in your onboarding packet as a content creator.

> [!IMPORTANT]   
> Regardless if you are contributing **new** content or curating migrated one, you should always:
> - fork the upstream repo to your account 
> - add your fork in **gitea.com** folder as a submodule 
> - not create any branch or commits in the upstream repos 
> - not create any branch or commits in **opentelekomcloud-docs/architecture-center**
> - open pull requests from your fork branch to upstream main when you are done
